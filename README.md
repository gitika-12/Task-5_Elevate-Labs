# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Objective  
To analyze the **Titanic passenger dataset**, uncover survival trends based on **demographic** and **socio-economic** factors, and create **data-driven visualizations** that clearly communicate the findings.

---

## 🔍 Step-by-Step Process  

### 1️⃣ Data Loading & Inspection  
- Imported dataset into **Jupyter Notebook** using `pandas`  
- Reviewed column structure, data types, and identified missing values  

### 2️⃣ Data Cleaning  
- Handled missing values in numerical & categorical columns  
- Converted columns to correct data types  
- Removed irrelevant or redundant information to maintain focus  

### 3️⃣ Statistical Overview  
- Generated descriptive statistics for numerical variables (`Age`, `Fare`, etc.)  
- Summarized categorical features like **Passenger Class**, **Gender**, and **Embarkation Point**  

### 4️⃣ Univariate Analysis  
- Visualized individual variables using histograms & count plots  
- Explored distributions of `Age`, `Fare`, `Survival`, `Passenger Class`, etc.  

### 5️⃣ Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis  
- Compared survival rates across **Gender**, **Class**, and **Age groups**  
- Created **pair plots** and **correlation heatmaps** to identify relationships between multiple features  

### 6️⃣ Data Visualization  
- Used **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** to build clear and attractive visualizations  
- Designed **visual storytelling charts** to highlight key survival patterns

## 📊 Key Insights  

- **Gender Impact** → Female passengers had a much higher survival rate than males  
- **Class Advantage** → 1st class passengers had significantly better survival chances than 2nd or 3rd class  
- **Age Factor** → Younger passengers, especially children, showed higher survival probabilities  
- **Embarkation Influence** → Passengers boarding from certain ports had different survival trends
